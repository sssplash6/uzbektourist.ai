## ✨ What is uzbektourist.ai?

**uzbektourist.ai** is a modern, minimal AI travel assistant designed to solve one of the biggest problems in tourism AI: **hallucination**.

Instead of generating generic, unreliable answers, this system is built on **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, ensuring that **every response is grounded in verified sources and fully cited**.

This project was built as part of an **AI systems engineering showcase for MBZUAI admissions**, demonstrating:

- End-to-end RAG pipelines
- Structured AI outputs
- Evaluation harnesses
- Knowledge base ingestion pipelines

---

## 🧠 Why This Matters

Tourists in Uzbekistan struggle to find **accurate, localized, and up-to-date information** about:

- Transport
- Visas & entry rules
- City navigation
- Safety
- Cultural etiquette

Most AI chatbots respond quickly — but **often incorrectly**.

> 🎯 Our goal: **Accuracy → Transparency → Trust.**

We prioritize **grounding, citations, and structured responses** over raw generation.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🔍 Smart Q&A
Concise, factual answers about:
- Transportation
- Safety
- Accommodation
- Food
- Routes
- Local tips

### 🗺️ Structured Itinerary Generation
- Clean **JSON → UI rendering**
- Morning / Afternoon / Evening breakdown
- Location-based planning

### 📚 RAG + Citations
- All responses grounded in `data/sources.json`
- Explicit citations for transparency

### ⚙️ Knowledge Base Ingestion
- Convert Markdown travel guides into retrievable AI knowledge

### 🧪 Evaluation Harness
- Automated regression checks
- JSON evaluation reports

### 💬 Feedback Loop (Optional)
- Store user feedback in Postgres
- Improve responses iteratively

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Tech |
|--------|------|
| Frontend | **Next.js 14 (App Router)** |
| Language | **TypeScript** |
| AI API | **OpenRouter (OpenAI-compatible)** |
| Retrieval | **TF‑IDF based lightweight RAG** |
| Storage | **Postgres (optional)** |
| Deployment | **Vercel** |

---

## 📦 Knowledge Base Ingestion

Maintain your knowledge base as clean Markdown files and convert them into retrievable AI sources:

```bash
KB_PATH="/absolute/path/to/backend/kb" npm run ingest:kb
```

This builds `data/sources.json`, enabling:

- Grounded generation
- Citation linking
- Fast retrieval

---

## 🧪 Evaluation & Testing

Run automated evaluation checks:

```bash
npm run eval
```

📄 Outputs:

```
eval/report.json
```

Used to:

- Detect regressions
- Track answer quality
- Validate citations

---

## 🚢 Deployment Guide (Vercel)

1. Import GitHub repo into Vercel
2. Configure environment variables:

```env
AI_BASE_URL=
AI_API_KEY=
AI_MODEL=
AI_HTTP_REFERER=  # optional
AI_APP_TITLE=    # optional
POSTGRES_URL=    # optional
```

3. Deploy 🚀

## 🔐 Responsible AI Principles

- ❌ No hallucinated prices, schedules, or routes
- ⚠️ Explicit uncertainty when sources are missing
- 📌 Mandatory citations for grounded answers
- 📊 Continuous evaluation & regression monitoring
