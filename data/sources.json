Its story is one of conquest, resilience, and remarkable cultural synthesis, making it a captivating destination for any traveler [[3]](https://thepartyingtraveler.com/travel-guide-samarkand-uzbekistan/) . Today, Samarkand is the third-largest city in Uzbekistan and a vibrant center of culture, scholarship, and trade, offering a unique opportunity to witness the legacy of history's most influential empires [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samarkand)[[3]](https://thepartyingtraveler.com/travel-guide-samarkand-uzbekistan/) .\n\n### Ancient Origins: Afrasiab and Marakanda\n\nThe history of Samarkand begins on the hills of Afrasiab, an ancient settlement founded between the 8th and 7th centuries BCE [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samarkand)[[2]](https://www.britannica.com/place/Samarkand-Uzbekistan)[[4]](https://www.advantour.com/uzbekistan/samarkand.htm)[[5]](https://www.advantour.com/uzbekistan/samarkand/things-to-do.htm) . This early city, known to the Greeks as Marakanda, was the heart of the ancient Iranian civilization of Sogdiana [[2]](https://www.britannica.com/place/Samarkand-Uzbekistan)[[6]](https://www.backpackadventures.org/things-to-do-in-samarkand/)[[7]](https://kalpak-travel.com/blog/samarkand-travel-guide/)[[8]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9GavSzElXM) . Strategically located in the fertile Zerafshan Valley, it became a thriving hub on the Great Silk Road, connecting China, Persia, and Europe [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samarkand)[[7]](https://kalpak-travel.com/blog/samarkand-travel-guide/)[[3]](https://thepartyingtraveler.com/travel-guide-samarkand-uzbekistan/)[[9]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmTNEpZDH6I) .

An Arab garrison and administration were established, Zoroastrian fire temples were razed, and a mosque was constructed [[5]](https://www.advantour.com/uzbekistan/samarkand/things-to-do.htm)[[16]](https://factsanddetails.com/central-asia/Uzbekistan/sub8_3d/entry-4704.html) . While the city was initially home to a diverse religious community of Zoroastrians, Buddhists, and Nestorian Christians, Islam gradually became the dominant faith [[12]](https://www.steppestravel.com/best-time-to-visit/uzbekistan/)[[5]](https://www.advantour.com/uzbekistan/samarkand/things-to-do.htm) .\n\nThe city reached a zenith of cultural and political significance under the Persian Samanid dynasty (819–999 CE), which established its capital in Samarkand before moving it to Bukhara [[17]](https://www.bookaway.com/routes/uzbekistan/samarkand)[[18]](https://travelshoebum.com/2024/05/23/a-comprehensive-travel-guide-for-samarkand/)[[5]](https://www.advantour.com/uzbekistan/samarkand/things-to-do.htm)[[19]](https://challenge-samarkand.com/news/flavours-of-samarkand-national-food/) . The Samanids were great patrons of arts and sciences, fostering a \"Persian renaissance\" that championed Persian language and culture [[18]](https://travelshoebum.com/2024/05/23/a-comprehensive-travel-guide-for-samarkand/)[[19]](https://challenge-samarkand.com/news/flavours-of-samarkand-national-food/)[[20]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW-q7TqSAFo) . During this period, Samarkand was a beacon of Islamic civilization and a vital node on numerous trade routes, with the Quran even being translated into Persian for the first time [[12]](https://www.steppestravel.com/best-time-to-visit/uzbekistan/)[[20]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW-q7TqSAFo) .\n\n### From Mongol Destruction to Timur's Jewel\n\nThe city's prosperity was shattered in 1220 when it was destroyed by Genghis Khan [[2]](https://www.britannica.com/place/Samarkand-Uzbekistan)[[21]](https://holiday-golightly.com/shopping-in-samarkand-and-bukhara/) . However, Samarkand's golden age arrived in the 14th century when it became the magnificent capital of the vast empire of Timur (Tamerlane) [[2]](https://www.britannica.com/place/Samarkand-Uzbekistan)[[6]](https://www.backpackadventures.org/things-to-do-in-samarkand/) . Timur transformed Samarkand into a major economic and cultural hub, commissioning the construction of breathtaking mosques, madrasahs, and mausoleums that continue to awe visitors today [[2]](https://www.britannica.com/place/Samarkand-Uzbekistan)[[6]](https://www.backpackadventures.org/things-to-do-in-samarkand/)[[13]](https://www.reddit.com/r/Uzbekistan/comments/1jsx4dl/whats_the_best_month_to_visit_uzbekistan/) .\n\n### The Soviet Era and Modern Recognition\n\nCenturies later, after the Russian conquest in the 19th century, Samarkand entered a new phase [[22]](https://inbetweentravels.com/samarkand-travel-guide/) . Following the Russian Revolution, it was designated the first capital of the newly formed Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic in 1924 [[21]](https://holiday-golightly.com/shopping-in-samarkand-and-bukhara/)[[23]](https://central-asia.guide/uzbekistan/destinations-uz/samarkand/afrasiyab/) . The choice was a calculated one, intended to project cultural respect to the Muslim world by selecting a \"purely indigenous, Muslim site\" over the Russian-dominated Tashkent [[23]](https://central-asia.guide/uzbekistan/destinations-uz/samarkand/afrasiyab/) . This status was short-lived; in 1930, the capital was moved to Tashkent, which was deemed the republic's primary economic and political hub [[22]](https://inbetweentravels.com/samarkand-travel-guide/)[[24]](https://veggiewayfarer.com/things-to-do-in-samarkand-itinerary/)[[5]](https://www.advantour.com/uzbekistan/samarkand/things-to-do.htm)[[25]](https://dailyspokesman.net/live/the-excavations-of-an-ancient-site-of-afrasiab-samarkand/) .

The culture is a blend of Islamic traditions and a deep-rooted respect for hospitality and elders.\n\n**General Etiquette**\n\n*   **Greetings:** The standard greeting is \"Assalomu alaykum\" (Peace be upon you), with the response \"Wa alaykum assalom\" (And peace be upon you). Men typically shake hands. A handshake between a man and a woman is usually initiated by the woman. Otherwise, a verbal greeting with a hand placed over the heart is common.\n*   **Respect for Elders:** Elders are highly respected. It is customary to give up your seat for them on public transport and to greet them first.\n*   **Hospitality:** Hospitality is a cornerstone of Uzbek culture. If invited to a local's home, it is polite to accept. It is customary to bring a small gift, such as sweets for the children. Always remove your shoes before entering a home.\n*   **Dining:** When dining, it is polite to accept tea and the first offerings of food. Use your right hand or both hands to pass items, as the left hand is considered unclean.\n*   **Public Behavior:** Avoid speaking loudly or showing public displays of affection. It is also considered rude to blow your nose loudly in public. Always ask for permission before photographing people.\n\n**Dress Code**\n\nWhile Tashkent is a modern city where Western-style clothing is common, it is important to dress modestly, especially when visiting religious sites or more conservative rural areas.\n\n*   **For Women:** Shoulders and knees should be covered. Avoid revealing clothing like short skirts, shorts, and low-cut tops. It is a good idea to carry a scarf or shawl, as you will need to cover your head when entering active mosques.\n*   **For Men:** Long trousers and shirts with sleeves are recommended, especially for visiting religious sites. Shorts that cover the knee are generally acceptable in the city.\n\n**Language**\n\nThe official language is Uzbek, a Turkic language. Russian is also widely spoken, especially in Tashkent and among the older generation, a legacy of the city's history as a Russian and Soviet administrative center [[6]](https://www.tashkent-hotels.com/tashkent/history.htm)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tashkent) . English is not widely spoken outside of the main tourist areas and hotels, so learning a few basic phrases will be greatly appreciated.\n\n**Basic Uzbek Phrases:**\n*   **Hello:** Salom (informal) / Assalomu alaykum (formal)\n*   **Thank you:** Rahmat\n*   **Yes:** Ha\n*   **No:** Yo'q\n*   **How much is this?:** Bu qancha turadi?\n*   **Goodbye:** Xayr\n\n**Basic Russian Phrases:**\n*   **Hello:** Здравствуйте (Zdravstvuyte)\n*   **Thank you:** Спасибо (Spasibo)\n*   **Yes:** Да (Da)\n*   **No:** Нет (Nyet)\n\n### Accommodation\n\nTashkent offers a wide range of accommodation to suit all budgets.

Citizens of many countries, including the US, UK, EU member states, and Canada, can enter Uzbekistan visa-free for up to 30 days.\n*   For longer stays or for citizens of other countries, an e-visa is often available and can be applied for online. Always check the latest visa requirements with your local Uzbek embassy or consulate before traveling.\n\n**Currency**\n\n*   The official currency is the **Uzbek Som (UZS)**.\n*   It is best to bring US dollars or Euros to exchange.

As a city that has been reborn multiple times—most recently after the devastating 1966 earthquake and the fall of the Soviet Union—it presents a unique architectural and cultural landscape shaped by imperial ambition, socialist utopianism, and national identity [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Tashkent)[[6]](https://www.tashkent-hotels.com/tashkent/history.htm)[[4]](https://handofcolors.in/tashkent-an-essence-of-soviet-era/) .\n\nFor the traveler, Tashkent is both accessible and rewarding. Its efficient public transport, particularly the stunningly ornate metro system, makes navigating the city's key attractions a breeze.

No visit is complete without witnessing the culinary spectacle at **Besh Qozon**, the Central Asian Plov Center, where Uzbekistan's national dish is prepared in giant cauldrons in a celebration of food, culture, and community [[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tashkent)[[12]](https://www.aramcoworld.com/articles/2020/tashkents-underground-masterpieces)[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Uzbekistan) .\n\nUnderstanding and respecting local customs is key to a fulfilling journey.
